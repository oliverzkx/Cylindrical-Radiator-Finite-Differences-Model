## Task 1: CPU Heat Propagation Simulation

### üìå Summary

This task implements horizontal 2D heat propagation using a finite difference method on the CPU. The program accepts customizable matrix sizes (`-n`, `-m`), number of iterations (`-p`), and supports early stopping via the `-a` option when any row reaches a certain average temperature.

------

### üß† Design Highlights

- Implemented horizontal-only heat diffusion using a weighted formula.
- Added early-stopping logic controlled by `-a <threshold>` argument.
- All operations respect boundary conditions with fixed left column values.
- Memory is dynamically allocated and reused across iterations.

------

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Parameters

| Flag | Description                               | Default |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `-n` | Number of rows (pipes)                    | `32`    |
| `-m` | Number of columns (temperature per pipe)  | `32`    |
| `-p` | Number of propagation iterations          | `10`    |
| `-a` | (Optional) Stop if average of any row ‚â• x | ‚Äì       |



------

### üß™ Example Tests

- ‚úÖ `./task1_cpu`
   Default 32√ó32, 10 iterations. Verified propagation works.
- ‚úÖ `./task1_cpu -n 5 -m 10`
   Confirmed non-square matrix is supported.
- ‚úÖ `./task1_cpu -n 64 -m 128 -p 50`
   Large grid simulation for 50 steps. Stable performance.
- ‚úÖ `./task1_cpu -n 64 -m 128 -p 100 -a 0.7`
   Stops early at row average temperature ‚â• 0.7. Works as expected.

------

### ‚úÖ Early Stopping Logic

Implemented early-exit based on average row temperature:

```cpp
float avg = row_sum / m;
if (avg >= stop_avg) break;
```

> This simulates a thermostat-style shutdown when local temperature exceeds the threshold.

| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |

| `Task 1: complete CPU implementation with matrix init...`  | Implemented core CPU logic  |
| `Finished Task 1: CPU heat propagation with -a early stop` | Completed with full testing |



------

### üìå Conclusion

Task 1 implementation is complete and tested. The code is robust, flexible, and meets all specification requirements. Early stopping was implemented to improve efficiency, and the simulation handles square and non-square systems without issue.



## Task 2 ‚Äì Parallel Heat Propagation (CUDA)

### üìù Objective

Implement a 2D heat propagation simulation using CUDA, replacing the CPU-only version from Task 1. Add support for row-wise average detection, shared memory optimization, and correctness verification.

### üß† Implementation Overview

- Implemented CUDA kernel (`heat_kernel.cu`) to parallelize heat updates.
- Added GPU-side row average detection using a separate kernel with shared memory.
- Used `cudaEvent_t` to time the propagation, memory transfer, and average calculation separately.
- Added CLI flags:
  - `-t`: enable timing
  - `-a`: stop early when average exceeds threshold
  - `-c`: skip CPU version (GPU only)

### ‚úÖ Correctness Verification

- Compared CPU and GPU results after fixed steps (`p=10`).
- Matrix difference < `1e-5`, and no mismatches above 0.0001, confirming correctness.

### ‚öíÔ∏è Challenges Encountered

- Initially had mismatch errors between CPU and GPU.
  - Cause: mistake in CPU control logic (early stop still active when comparing).
  - Solution: disabled CPU early stop during comparison (`use_stop_cpu = false`).
- Debugged shared memory indexing in `row_avg_kernel`, fixed with gridDim/blockDim check.

### üîç Key Improvements

- Significant performance gains with shared memory in `row_avg_kernel`.
- Correct comparison between CPU and GPU enabled via debug tools and conditional flags.



## Task 3 ‚Äì Performance Optimization and Benchmarking

### üìù Objective

Profile and optimize the CUDA implementation from Task 2. Experiment with different thread block configurations and analyze performance impact using large-scale simulations.

------

### üß† Strategy

- Fixed simulation size:
   `n = 15360`, `m = 15360`, `p = 1000` as reference.
- Tested various CUDA block sizes:
  - `(16,16)`, `(32,32)`, `(32,8)`, `(64,4)`, `(128,2)`, `(64,1)`, `(1,256)`, `(8,64)`
- Measured:
  - Total GPU time
  - CUDA kernel time (propagation)
  - Speedup vs CPU
  - Max matrix difference (precision)

------

Tested multiple block sizes to find the best performance:

| Block Size (x√óy) | GPU Time (ms) | Observations       |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| 16√ó16            | ~5900         | Baseline           |
| 32√ó32            | ~7800         | Slower (too large) |
| 32√ó8             | ~4500         | ‚úÖ Good balance     |
| 64√ó4             | **~4400**     | ‚úÖ‚úÖ Best overall    |
| 128√ó2            | ~5000+        | Slower             |
| 1√ó256            | ~46000        | ‚ùå Very inefficient |

Optimal configuration used for final tests: **`dim3(64, 4)`**

‚úÖ All tests passed numerical threshold of `1e-4`.
 üö´ Avoid early-stopping when comparing CPU-GPU results.
